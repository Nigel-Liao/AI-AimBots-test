The first AI automatic aiming robot uses the yolov5 api, which is the fastest in the open source game AI automatic robot I know so far. The other is to use the mediapipe api, which is efficient and has a skeleton effect, making it easier to identify the head, but less efficient when there are multiple people.
Because I am not an expert in AI design, and the environment is not well set up, so that the effect is low, I think it can be improved 1. Recognition efficiency (increase fps, and aiming accuracy) 2. Do not repeat aiming for corpses 3. Lock range and automatic Turn to fire etc...more on that later.

The scripts are all based on autohotkey. The pressure gun script I found on the Internet and slightly modified, the array is really cool. The burst is researched by myself, it is useless, at most let your 30-30 upgrade from M1 Garand to M14, ㄏ ㄏ.

The above are all translated with google translate, why? Because my English suck and I'm almost failing QAQ.
